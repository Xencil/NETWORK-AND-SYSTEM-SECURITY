    "#REFLECTION\n",
    "#Through this seminar I have learned how to combine different cyber security concepts into one single program, learning about how each technique places its part in monitoring and detecting threats.\n",
    "# One of the concepts I went over was monitoring file integrity. To do this I made use of sha256 hashing when looking at hashes for files in a folder then comparing it to the baseline. This allowed me too know what changes were made on the files which showcased to me how checks like this can show unauthorized modifications to a file. The downside with this method having to hash many files can be time consuming but not checking risks missing modifications occurring without you knowing.\n",
    "# Another concept was scanning based on patterns. I utilized regular expressions operations that could be intentionally malicious. This taught me to incorporate knowledge I already knew from previous models into detecting suspicious network activity. However whilst completing this, I came to the realisation that pattern based methods like regex scanning can result in false positives being triggered by partial matches or comments matching the patterns the user enters. So whilst this method is effective it still may not be reliable enough.\n",
    "# The last concept I went over was how the spread of infection looks like through a simulated environment. When doing this it became clear how a probabilistic model can reflect trends in how malware would move across ones network. Utilizing different variables let me see how different conditions can result in the infection spreading faster. However the model I created has its own limitations. Each device is treats as the same which isn’t realistic as in other networks there would be different connection structures and protections present. Also the threshold alert system can result in false alarms as there is not context given.\n",
    "# Overall this seminar has resulted in me increasing my understanding in how security monitoring functions through a practical example, and how different layers of security can result in a more effective solution.\n"
